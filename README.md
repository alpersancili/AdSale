Modeling the Impact of Advertising Expenditures on Sales Using Multiple Linear Regression ðŸ“ˆ
In this project, I developed a multiple linear regression model to analyze and predict the impact of advertising expenditures on sales. Using Python, I explored how different types of advertising (such as TV, radio, and online) contribute to sales performance, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of various marketing strategies.

Project Overview
Objective: To understand the relationship between different advertising channels and their combined effect on sales.
Data: The dataset includes advertising expenditures across various channels and the corresponding sales figures.
Methodology: I used multiple linear regression to model the relationship between independent variables (advertising expenditures) and the dependent variable (sales).
Tools and Libraries: The project was implemented using Python with key libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, model building, and visualization.
Key Steps
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning the dataset and handling any missing values.
Exploring the data through summary statistics and visualizations.
Model Building:

Developing a multiple linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising expenditures.
Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).
Insights and Analysis:

Analyzing the coefficients to understand the impact of each advertising channel on sales.
Visualizing the relationship between actual sales and predicted sales.
Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of how different advertising strategies affect sales. The multiple linear regression model offers a quantitative way to evaluate the return on investment (ROI) for each advertising channel, helping businesses make informed decisions on where to allocate their marketing budgets.
